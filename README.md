# MapGen
Generating a fictional map at the regional level.

1) I can generate a random regional map (approx. 1 month travelling each direction from center)
2) I can give this map parameters to adjust how it generates the map (more water, less mountains, etc)
3) There is random structures there for spice (ruins, temple, dungeon, etc)
4) There is random lore behind each structure (the old king Henry ruled here, before it was taken by the plague)
5) I can add random factions (the old king Henry ruled the Royal Iron, a fierce military organization)
6) Each faction has conqured territory (Royal Iron controlled most of the east)
7) Factions have random lore (The Royal Iron was formed after barbarians destroyed most of his homeland, they seek to rule all, etc)
